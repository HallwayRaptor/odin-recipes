        <h2>A Classic French Recipe</h2>

        <p>This is a recipe for a traditional French omelette. A traditional French omelette uses only a few simple ingredients to create a delicious lunch dish with no frills but lots of flavour.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tbs butter</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch of black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat butter in a non-stick pan over medium heat. <em>Do not brown the butter</em></li>
            <li>While butter is heating vigorously mix eggs, salt, and pepper with a fork or tiny whisk</li>
            <li>Pour the eggs into the pan</li>
            <li>Vigourously stir the eggs with a small silicone spatula or fork. If you're using a fork be careful not to scrape the pan with the tongs</li>
            <li>Constantly shake the pan with your other hand while stirring the eggs to evenly distribute the eggs and prevent clumping</li>
            <li>When the eggs stop filling in the scraped areas reduce heat and smooth out with the spatula</li>
            <li>Once the eggs are no longer liquid on top carefully fold the edge closest to the handle on top of itself, about 1 inch in.</li>
            <li>Continue flipping until you are about 2 inches from the end. Then flip the other side on top</li>
            <li>Without flipping the egg, melt some butter under the omelette for about 3 seconds</li>
            <li>Pick up the pan and, using the spatula or fork, flip the omelette over on to your plate so the crease is underneath</li>
            <li>(Optional) Garnish with paprika and chives</li>
        </ol>
